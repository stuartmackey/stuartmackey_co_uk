    <p>I have a lot of friends that never really knew what they wanted to do when they 'grew up'.  I find that difficult to relate to them because I always wanted to be a programmer from the very first time I typed</p>

<p>  10 PRINT "STUART IS COOL"
  20 GOTO 10</p>

<p>on my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>.  Ever since that day I have wanted to develop games.  I have started work on loads of them but never followed through.  Last night I started watching <a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game: The Movie</a>.  In addition to really enjoying the movie I was left with the happy feeling that at least there were some people who, like me, always dreamt of writing a game but actually got up off their asses and did it.</p>

<p>If you have even a passing interest in Indie games and development you should check it out.</p>

<p>Maybe some day I will finally write Super Cars 3.</p>

<p>UPDATE: It turns out that someone actually wrote a Super Cars 3 for windows.  Time to set up a Windows VM. :-)</p>
