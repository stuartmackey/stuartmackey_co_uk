    <p>We have just completed the move from Tumblr to self hosting for our development blog. Previously, when it was only me doing all the development it was hosted in my tumblr account but now that we have more development staff it seemed the time was right to self host.  I found out about <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> over the weekend and thought I would take some time today to play around with it.  So far I am very impressed, set up was easy, I was able to import old Tumblr entries and configure the CSS to make it look a little more like the Paper Bag site.</p>

<p>Now all we have to do is start writing again. Hopefully it won't just be me posting here from now on.</p>
