    <p>In a past life I was a .net developer and one of the things I loved about .net was Test Driven Development (TDD). When I moved to Objective-C and iOS development the first thing I looked for was a unit testing framework. At the time there really wasn't very much to help you, and the tools were far from perfect. Eventually I gave up looking, fooling myself into thinking that doing TDD for such a heavily UI based platform probably wouldn't be much use anyway.</p>

<p>Over the years I did look at TDD occasionally but if I was being honest with myself, not very hard. A few months ago I heard on twitter that a book was to be released on TDD for iOS, I was sceptical but interested.</p>

<p>The book was <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Test-driven-IOS-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0321774183/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1346182401&amp;sr=8-1">Test Driven iOS Development</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/secboffin">Graham Lee</a>.</p>

<p>It took me a while to get around to reading it but I am very glad that I did. It is an excellent book, written specifically for experienced iOS developers who want a solid introduction to developing testable applications. The main success of the book is not bothering with lots of simple contrived examples, it centres around the development of a single app with each chapter adding more and more functionality.</p>

<p>I have to confess that the book is not perfect, there are quite a few errors and it can be hard to follow at times but overall it is worth it. Anyone that is even slightly interested in TDD for iOS should give it a read.</p>

<p>We have been using TDD for about a month now and while it hasn't been plain sailing all the way I think we are starting to see real benefits.</p>
