    <p>For me, part of this week has been dedicated to looking creating responsive web sites in Rails.  It is something that has been on our radar for a while now but kept getting pushed back.  We have a few upcoming projects in that area so I could push it no longer.</p>

<p>Web development is something that I have been fairly removed from for a few years now and going back to it has been a bit of an eye opener.  As with all development these days it feels like there are 100s of approaches.  I was aware of the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/index.html">Twitter Bootstrap Project</a> because of another project but there is also <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a>, <a href="http://www.designinfluences.com/fluid960gs/">Fluid 960</a> and many others.</p>

<p>I concentrated most of my investigation on Foundation and Twitter Bootstrap.  After a few false starts we have settled on Twitter Bootstrap as our preferred choice.  Foundation loooked excellent but Twitter Bootstrap felt easier to work with.</p>

<p>As I mentioned we will be working a lot in this area in the future so I am sure there will be most posts about it.</p>
