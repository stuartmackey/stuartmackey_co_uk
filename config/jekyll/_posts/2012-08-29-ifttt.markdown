Now that we have switched to using Octopress I have been trying to find a service that will auto post tweets when a new blog entry has been added. This morning I found [ifttt.com](http://ifttt.com/). The UI that they use to create the rules is very impressive, it reminds me of the [Amen](https://getamen.com/) iOS app.  

This post it also partly a test to check if the tweets are being created correctly, fingers crossed.
