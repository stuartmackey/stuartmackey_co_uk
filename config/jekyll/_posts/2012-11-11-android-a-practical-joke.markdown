In general Paper Bag does the majority of its work on the iOS platform.  I can't really think of an exact number but it is probably around 70-80% iOS, the rest is divided up between Android and Blackberry.  

For the last couple of weeks we have however been developing an application for a client in both Blackberry and Android.  For anyone that has developed in for the Blackberry platform you will know that it can be a very frustrating experience.  The problems of Blackberry pale into insignificance in comparison to the problems we have been having with Android.  

The last Android project we did was for v2.x and it was difficult enough but now that 4.x is on the scene I am seriously starting to think that it is all just one massive joke that Google are playing on us.  Many people will think that I am just an Apple Fanboi having a rant and maybe they are right but I don't think I am being biased.  iOS has plenty of frustrations but at least I feel that there is a guiding hand somewhere up there that is trying to do its best, with Android I get no such fuzzy feeling.  Parts get depricated with no real alternative (e.g. Activites for Tabs being replaced by fragments), certain controls lack even basic functionality that you would expect in a v1 let alone a v4 (e.g. pan and zoom detection in MapView) and countless other things that have left me both baffled and all the team banging our heads against a wall.

On Thursday afternoon I finally was able to put into words how a felt about the hole business.  I feel like we are developing using an SDK that was written as a final year project.  Maybe the coming weeks will lead me to an epiphany and I will 'get' Android, it cannot come quickly enough.
