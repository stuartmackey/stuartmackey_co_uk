Note: This is a follow up on a [previous post](test-driven-ios-development.html).

We are coming to the end of our first true iOS with TDD project.  Overall the project went incredibly well both from a technical and commerical point of view.  The customer is very happy and we delivered on time and on budget.  

If I am being honest I am not sure whether we succeeded because of or inspite of the TDD.  Looking back at the code there is still a lot that we did wrong but we do have about 500 tests waiting to help catch any mistakes we may make in the future so we certainly did something right.  As with all TDD it is really about training your mind to think differently than it being technically difficult to implement.  Objective-C certainly has its own little idiosyncrasies but mostly I think it actually helped when it came to being able to UI element testing.

The [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Test-driven-IOS-Development-Developers-Library/dp/0321774183/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1346182401&sr=8-1) that I mentioned in my [original post ](test-driven-ios-development.html) was excellent.  In the end we deviated from it quite a bit and actually implemented a lot of our code using blocks rather than delegates but, in general, it was an excellent base to start from.  

Now that we have lived through our first project I can be fairly confident that most, if not all, projects will be using it in the future.
