I have a lot of friends that never really knew what they wanted to do when they 'grew up'.  I find that difficult to relate to them because I always wanted to be a programmer from the very first time I typed


  10 PRINT "STUART IS COOL"
  20 GOTO 10

on my [ZX Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum).  Ever since that day I have wanted to develop games.  I have started work on loads of them but never followed through.  Last night I started watching [Indie Game: The Movie](http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/).  In addition to really enjoying the movie I was left with the happy feeling that at least there were some people who, like me, always dreamt of writing a game but actually got up off their asses and did it.

If you have even a passing interest in Indie games and development you should check it out.

Maybe some day I will finally write Super Cars 3.

UPDATE: It turns out that someone actually wrote a Super Cars 3 for windows.  Time to set up a Windows VM. :-)
